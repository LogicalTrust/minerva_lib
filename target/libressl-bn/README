Installation
------------

Build libressl:

 Prepare sources:

 $ git clone https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable
 $ cd portable
 $ ./autogen.sh

 Compile (the example builds it with Address Sanitizer):

 $ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure
 $ make -j4


Create the following symlinks (or copy necessary files), this command should
be performed in the target library:

$ ln -s /dir/to/libressl/include include_dir
$ ln -s /dir/to/libressl/crypto/.libs/libcompat.a
$ ln -s /dir/to/libressl/crypto/.libs/libcrypto.a

We assume libressl-portable usage, in case you use it natively you have to do
some shifts in the Makefile with libcompat.a (which  is not necessary).
